 During my hectic period of studying for the CFA Level 2 Exam, I visited Dr. John’s Concussion Clinic twice a week to keep my recovery going. I guess I was going a bit crazy with my last minute cramming of the exam, and looked stressed. “Insert emoji” On a random day in Mid-May, I stopped by the clinic and was expecting just to get some adjustments and exercise tips as usual, but…

When I was laying down and having my neck adjusted, Dr. John asked me, “So what’s the point of life Sophie?” And I was like … “insert emoji - umm, trying to relax and think on this philosophical question at the same time” 

Dr. John continued to say, “Our purpose is to serve. It’s an inside out journey - there are always things out there, but it only matters if you truly want it, deep down; or else having those things don’t mean anything.”

I got up and Dr. John continued, saying “You are a joyful sponge and a giver - just that I need to peel off the layers (distractions) to help you see clearer.” Doubting my profession and where it will take me, Dr. John reassured me that I am in an important profession and with a little more experience, I will have so much potential. 

“Life is short. You must engage in life, live your life, and celebrate it. You own it all. The world is scared of peace and love, so we ourselves must be filled with peace and love so we can radiate onto others.” 

Perhaps it’s the pandemic fatigue hitting us all, and although suicide and depression rates are going up, Dr. John reaffirmed, “Don’t accept it. Take it and crash it.” -emoji-

Chiro visit of a lifetime.
