title: 'Road Trip from Calgary -> SF -> L.A. Along HW1'

Driving along highway 1 has always been on my bucket list, and my parents and I felt the timing was perfect in August 2019 - to take my mind off from the accident in earlier January 2019. We planned for an approximately 2 weeks driving from northern -> south along HW1, stopping by Oregon (woodburn), SF, L.A, and ofc, Yosemite. Overall the drive can be long/exhausting, and safety first so I think having 2-3 experienced drivers to rotate def takes the load off of the shoulders and can spend more time immersing in the beautiful scenery instead of fighting off fatigue! Overall we spent most of our time in city and didn’t do any big hikes in Yosemite given my foot injuries, but regardless, west coast is gorgeous and I would do the drive along HW1 anytime again with friends and families in a heartbeat!

#### Days 1 - 2: Calgary -> Oregon 
Oregon/Woodburn was our first “full” stop after a 14-hours drive from Calgary. The drive to/in Oregon was actually gorgeous, and was like a prelude to HW1! We did some shopping in the outlet, and visited Redwood National Park - tried my best to hug a tree!

#### Days 3 - 5: Within San Francisco 

We arrived at SF after a 10 hours drive from Oregon; for the evening in SF, we ate some good food in SF and mostly relaxed to recharge for the upcoming 2 full itineraries within SF. 

Most of my friends are in Software Eng and all they talk about is life in SF (jk I love my friends), so perhaps I naturally already built a connection with the city, but coming from an Accounting/Fin background working in B4, I loved how upbeat, free, and fresh SF feels! 

On Day 4, we visited: Golden Gate/Baker Beach, Ghirardelli Square, Palace of Fine Arts, & Lombard Street. Ofc, we saved Fisherman’s Wharf, Pier 39 for the evening to catch the sunset.

On Day 5, we visited Japanese Tea Garden Park in the morning! The design is so exquisite and 俊俏 which makes us want to visit Japan ASAP!! Then, we headed to Dolores Park, Alamo Square & the Painted Ladies.

Overall, SF is ___, a pet-friendly and colourful city, __. After visiting, I definitely had the thought of moving to SF post graduation - love the less-constrained vibe being near water, and less snow (warmer). 

#### Days 6 - 7: Drive Along HW1 
The drive of a lifetime - my parents and I were constantly “fighting” who to take shotgun! There are so many stops and towns along the drive, and ofc, secret gems that we need to stop by the next time! We were surprised by the diverse culture that HW1 includes, and saw so many professional cyclists and are inspired by their persistence and love for nature. There are so many activities: cycling, wine-tasting, surfing, etc. Each stop is fairly close-by, so you have a lot of flexibility to plan your trip! Here’s a list of stops we pulled by: 

Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
Monterey
Visit: Monterey Peninsula, Cannery Row, Rent bikes to follow the coast south around the peninsula to Pacific Grove, Asilomar State Beach, and the sea-and-spray beauty (and gazillion-dollar homes and celebrated Pebble Beach golf courses) along the 17-Mile Drive.
Big Sur: Drive Big Sur’s length via twisting Highway One. Pull over at: Bixby Bridge, McWay Falls, Overlook Trail. 
San Luis Obispo: Mission Plaza, Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, farmers market, visit DT
Solvang City (丹麦风格)
Santa Barbara (33 mins). Visit: Stearns Wharf, State Street (shops dining),  Old Mission Santa Barbara, East Beach


#### Days 8 - 10: Within L.A. (wear lots of sunscreen)

L.A. gave us more of a city-vibe vibrant compared to SF, given its emphasis on Entertainment, but nevertheless, the palm trees and hood-less cars was so enjoyable.

On Day 8: We started our day driving down Sunset Boulevard and visited Universal Studios for half a day (highly recommend buy ticket online). Then Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Getty Museum. Ofc, we saved Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach Boardwalk - by now you can guess that I’m obsessed with sunsets :P.

On Day 9: Hollywood Walk of Fame; seeing sunset at Griffith Observatory was so beautiful.
HOLLYWOOD SIGN. Kodak Theatre.

On Day 10: Stanford.

Overall, L.A. was a lot sunnier than SF, and a lot more fine arts focused than S.F. This is where dreams come true, i.e. reference La La Land

#### Day 11: Yosemite

Couldn’t hike due to foot injuries; grew up in Alberta, so familiar with the mountains but afraid of height LOL

#### Days 12 - 13: Home
