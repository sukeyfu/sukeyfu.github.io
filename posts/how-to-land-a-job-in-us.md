With an academic background in Accounting and Finance having passed CPA Canada and CFA exams, as well as almost 2 years of work experience in Audit, I received ~20 interviews for Accounting Advisory, Transaction Services, Internal Audit Consulting or FP&A Analysts positions in San Francisco and New York. 

I started applying/interviewing in late December 2021 until early-February 2022. During this time, it is the #Great Resignation period where it was a really hot job market for job seekers, so I was quite fortunate with the timing. Also, I did have a diverse and fulfilling experience at PwC Assurance, exposed to a variety of industries and projects, so this goes back to the saying: no matter what you do, do it well!

By now, I trust that you’ve gone through a `checklist` and made your decision to switch jobs, so let’s dive in:

> Q: Job hunting in U.S. as a Canadian
#### A: Most firms that I applied to were willing to sponsor a visa if they decide to hire you! The most frequent question I got asked was why I want to move to the U.S., and employers want to understand if you have solid reasons for wanting to make the transition. 

> Q: Resume tips 
#### A: Starting off with the general tips:
1. Use a professional template and format so the resume is easy to read and follow along.
2. Avoid repeating the same “content” twice - don’t have to include hobbies/interests if not necessary and short on space.
3. Showcase a holistic set of technical and soft skills through various positions.

But to make your resume really stand out:
1. **Build a storyline:** your experience, in reverse chronological order, should have a `logical flow` that showcases not only your experience and expertise, but also your growth/development. This shows that you’re a well-rounded candidate with even more potential for growth.
2. **Write your own:** I don’t recommend rephrasing other people’s similar experience listed on their Linkedin page because you lose the uniqueness, hence, your resume doesn't stand out. It’s fine to look to get a sense of scope/structure, but ultimately, start brainstorming and re-collecting your memories to filter your own “shining points”.
3. **Understand the greater impact:** when preparing your resume, you should ask yourself, “What’s really the deeper purpose behind this project/experience?” It’s okay to not have actually achieved that greater impact, (don’t lie on your resume), but keeping the greater impact in mind when editing your resume honestly changes how you phrase your bullet points with a big-picture mindset, rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty details. 

> Q: Interview tips 
#### A: Unlike applying to my first co-op job during 2nd year of undergrad, where I spent hours and hours on drafting full-sentence responses for those common interview questions, this time around, 4 years later, all my prep work was mostly to understand the company/ job. Partially because I was also simultaneously working 70 hour weeks for my full-time job, I felt I was half yolo-ing all my interviews (especially technicals) with the little time I had on prep. “Lol”. Definitely talk to upper year alumni as well as mentors on interview tips, but here’s some unique points that I find beneficial:

1. **Be genuine:** this is the most important of all, because this way you can really see if you’re a good fit with the firm (the vibe check). Especially with the hiring managers whom you will perhaps be working with, it’s best to make it less like an interview, but create an environment that fosters a daily work conversation. I was asked questions such as, “What’s the hardest thing about working from home?”, “If I could go back and change one bad event at work, what would I have done differently?”, “Why not make the career switch at the end of undergrad instead of waiting until now?” Don’t be pretentious during an interview, because that’s not sustainable. Honesty makes us imperfect, but is also the most unique and memorable. 


2. **Be convincing:** during an interview, you’re communicating more about yourself that’s not on your resume: your personality, values, workstyle, etc. In order to be successful, in addition to being who you are, you have to be convincing of who you are, for example, through the “introduce yourself” and “run me through your resume” questions. For these two questions, it’s beneficial to incorporate why you want the job and make the career switch. However, diving into the specific questions on your experience, be sure to showcase both “what’s difficult about the experience” and “what you did differently to create impact” to really let your response sink in with the interviewer. 


3. **Understand the “job”:** for my interviews, I find that half of the questions are focused on you, and the other half is on your understanding of the new job. So it’s important to understand the purpose of the new job and what it takes, then, you can pick and choose which experience of yours to share to help bridge the gap. Also, understand beyond what you will be doing, but also the people you will work with! 

> Q: Should I apply to everything? 
#### A: For me, I was open to a variety of positions but I know for sure the jobs that I definitely am not interested in. This way, I started applying fairly quickly, immediately after I had my resume ready. Honestly, I think it’s beneficial to not hold on until you figure out the “dream job” and just start applying and interviewing, because during the process you’re able to better learn what would be a good fit for you! Then, apply selectively to make the process more efficient. 

> Q: Application process
#### A: Typically, your resume is screened in a week (excluding holidays), so if you’re selected, the recruiter would reach out to you to have an initial phone screen - this is very generic, and usually doesn’t deep dive into your resume. Then, in the following week, you would have 2-3 rounds with the hiring managers (those who work in the same group as the job you applied for). I find that if you land an initial recruiter call, you’ll 99% proceed to the next rounds. Afterwards, within a week, you should hear back from the recruiter on the final results - sometimes even the next business day!

My tip is to `stay organised` by setting up an excel tracker/google spreadsheet to track all the applications, status, key dates, etc., so you don't make any small mistakes during interviews - that can be awkward! “Lol”. my tracker has the following headers:

Best of luck everyone, and feel free to `send a message` if you have any other questions!!
