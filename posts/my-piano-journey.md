Unlike most of my elementary classmates forced by their parents to learn a musical instrument, I begged my parents for a whole year, and was finally able to start learning piano at the age of 5. My mother, being a practical parent, figured that my dad and herself both have no musical genetics, and piano, unlike violin, is an extremely difficult piece of furniture to dispose of if things go south “LOL”. I don’t remember at all why I was obsessed with piano as a kid, or where I even had heard of classical music to begin with, but my persistence and patience finally “convinced” my mom, and I started learning piano with a Professor at Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. 

When I was 10 years old, my Professor secretly had a conversation with my mom about letting me pursue a career as a professional pianist. It was a big decision at the time, and the timing was tricky given they already had plans for immigrating to Canada, so they put it on hold.

After settling down in Calgary when I was 12 years old, we started searching for a new piano teacher, which is always a two way relationship: the teacher sees something special in you for wanting to take in as a student, and the student’s musical style and personality shall be a good fit with the teacher. 

Finally, I was so fortunate to have met [Alla](https://alexandraandrievsky.ca/) as my piano teacher. It’s been more than 10 years being her piano student, and I feel a special spiritual connection with her through music. Alla is the most elegant, righteous, kind, and encouraging musician/individual I know, and she truly feels like my family (Seriously, like a second mom). I really think this is faith - coincidentally, her daughter was my junior high-school classmate, and also a special friend growing up.

Fast forward to 2014 when I took The Royal Conservatory of Music’s Associate Diploma (ARCT) Exam when I was 16 years old, which, to date after writing countless school/professional designation exams, still remains to be the hardest exam in my life. On the exam date, after I finished performing a 60-minute long program, the adjudicator stopped me from leaving the room, and asked me how old I am, and whether I plan on pursuing music professionally. “Lol”.

Passing the ARCT Exam is just the beginning of my journey. Afterwards, I took a 5 years “gap” from piano to complete my undergraduate study at Waterloo. 

A silver lining to this Pandemic starting in 2020 is that I have been able to re-connect and gain a deeper connection with, in particularly, Chopin and Beethoven’s music. Music is like the universe - vast, accepting, and constantly changing (subjectively speaking). I often say that one lifetime isn’t long enough to thoroughly and completely understand one composer’s compositions, let alone, there are hundreds and thousands of classical music composers…

Anyhow, I will continue to try my best to balance the life of being both a Finance professional & Pianist.
