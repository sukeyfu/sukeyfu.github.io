Getting a quality night of sleep is so important because it gives you the energy and fuel to fight off pain and fatigue. I was working with an Occupational Therapist and she suggested the following:
1. **Weighted Blanket**: This varies person to person, I found it helpful, but a weighted blanket on its own doesn’t necessarily contribute to a good night’s sleep.
2. **Yoga/Breathing Exercises**: Let your body be in a relaxed mode. The key is to stay away from using your phone/devices before bed and forget about work!  
3. **Suitable Environment**: A quiet and cozy bedroom, with a diffuser using your favorite diffusing oil.
4. **Proper Routine**: Having a proper sleep schedule is so important; bad (2AM) schedule > no schedule!
