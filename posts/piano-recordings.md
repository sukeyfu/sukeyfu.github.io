1. **Faith**: we cannot fully control or own anything in life, but knowing music (something we connect with) will always be here as a companion feels comforting. Through music, we are able to explore more of the unexplored universe, listening to and experiencing various composers’ different personalities, cultures, stories, emotions; altogether, this makes us more human.
2. **Self-Discovery**: For musicians, in addition to initially strategizing on tackling technical challenges (like solving a puzzle), they constantly listen and self-reflect to seek their own unique interpretation of a composer’s music. Throughout this process, I often realize that I am flawed and that there is so much for me to improve on, but at the end of the day, it’s all about accepting my flaws and letting go.
3. **Reality Check**: performing music is very similar to being an actor/actress - portraying a “scripted” story in front of a real audience. You have to stay conscious to adjust to the surroundings, but simultaneously “being in the moment” to genuinely convey real emotions. It sounds very contradictory - honestly like much of our daily lives, where we sometimes have to compromise our true values and beliefs to fit in. But seeing the satisfaction that music brings to the audience, it further reminds me that music has the power to heal, which keeps me motivated and stays in check.
