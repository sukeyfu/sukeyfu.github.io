In today’s complex and fast-paced world, it is harder and harder to be able to grasp our own identity and truly understand who we are. It seems like every second there are 1000 things going on in the world, and that we have so many options available to us. We are only an app away from the other side of the world, and can even live-stream a war… all thanks to social media. 

Our life is becoming more accessible, hence, it is easier for us to become more educated and empowered, but then, why are we feeling lost more than ever? 

I mean, we are never 100% clear of who we are and the purpose of our life, but if you find yourself working 80-100 hour weeks, or on the other extreme, not engaging in any meaningful work, it is so easy to get side-tracked, and end up questioning what’s the point of all this. 

In my opinion, there are 2 contributing factors to this: 1) Life is entirely dedicated to only one dimension of our life (i.e. work), and 2) Not being mindful of our own thoughts and surroundings. 

There is a saying, “To see a world in a grain of sand and a Heaven in a Wild Flower”, which relates to the concept of Mindfulness - to feel the connection and seek depth in everything we do and connect with. This is not necessarily contradictory to living a fast-paced life, but often, doing things at a fast-speed (focusing on the surface level) neglects the in-depth details that are the fundamentals in discovering who we are.

Without possessing a greater love for the world, it is hard to be mindful of our surroundings. This is personally something that I’m still working on after having a conversation with my Psychotherapist. He suggested that everything in nature, including ourselves, gives what is designed to give, and we must respect and maintain a harmonic relationship that we have with them. This will lead us to inner peace and fulfilment, and ultimately sets the fundamentals to determine how we choose to position ourselves in the world. 

Life is made up of millions of small memories and events, and it’s how we comprehend these small pieces of our lives that make up who we are. I think it’s so important to live a multi-dimensional life, to be able to create and experience life. Yes, everyone can have different weightings and finding the right % of allocation is a life-long learning. 

Personally, I find the following 3 dimensions to be essentials in living a conscious, healthy and meaningful life: 

1. **Physical - to feel refreshed**: 
The fundamentals - Fresh air, 6 glasses of water, a “fun” self-talk/self-care routine, i.e. meditation
2. **Emotional - to console in others**:
Clear realisation of what makes us content and confident - Meaningful work, dedicated hobbies, friends/family time & conversations
3. **Spiritual - to have a free spirit and courageous soul**: 
Alignment between what we think, say, and do

To quote Yohji Yamamoto, “Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find yourself.”
