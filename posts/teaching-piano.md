An opportunity came to me from my dearest piano teacher, [Alexandra Andrievsky](https://alexandraandrievsky.ca/), when I was 15 years old. Having learned and practised piano for 10 years at the time, Alla encouraged me to take on the perspective of a teacher and teach, which also gives me different insights as a performer myself. 

So my journey began, and is still ongoing... 

In Grade 12, where my International Baccalaureate course load became lighter, I was more heavily involved in teaching: offering both in-home and in-studio piano lessons for 6 days a week to 20+ students. I am forever grateful for Paula and Kuba from [Bowtown Music](https://www.bowtownmusic.com/), who believed in me from Day 1 (audition/interview) - I still recall the joy on their faces after I played Chopin’s Op 48. No.1 Nocturne.

I genuinely enjoyed teaching, especially going for in-home piano lessons, where students are more relaxed in a more familiar environment (as opposed to being in-studio) - this way, I feel it is easier to build a more meaningful connection and learn more about my students. At the end of lessons, it is also more convenient and flexible to chat with the parents, initially starting from discussing their expectations and how their children are progressing in piano, then to what extent they should be a part of their children’s piano journey, eventually to which bar in Calgary has the best dance floor “insert emoji”.

Growing up as a single child, being the older “sibling” around my students made me so happy - when they hear the doorbell ring, I could hear them fighting over who’s the one to open the door for me; when I come in, they would run towards me with their piano book and proudly show me which piece they conquered over the week; and after the lesson, they would run towards their parents and proudly tell them what we’ve learned during the lesson. Of course, every student has a different learning style and is at different technical levels; as such, I often tailor my teaching (communication) style and develop unique teaching plans towards each student. My philosophy is to make piano lessons fun, and also fulfilling - this doesn’t mean that every lesson is a breeze, rather, my students and I face a weekly challenge, and together learn new skill sets such that my students can tackle it with confidence! These life-long transferable skills (persistence and patience) will benefit them throughout their lives!

Overall, It was so meaningful and encouraging for me to be able to pass on my knowledge to the new generation, and seeing them learn more about themselves and grow confidence through piano. 

However, there is always the administrative side of things, which can easily get messy, especially managing 20+ students & their parents simultaneously. Thankfully, I kept on track through Google Calendar, and the organisational skills that I was able to develop carried on with me even until today. 

Nowadays, I mostly teach adult students, so the teaching approach is drastically different (Yes, I can be a bit tougher at times :P). Music will always be a part of me and my life, and I am also seeking alternative ways to give back to the community, on top of teaching. For example, during the pandemic, I organised and performed for the elders at their retirement centre… more exciting things to come!
