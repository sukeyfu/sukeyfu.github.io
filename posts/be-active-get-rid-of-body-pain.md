I participated in a variety of treatments to heal from all sorts of pain throughout my body, starting from neck down to my foot. Generally, I found that there is no one treatment that just “heals it all”. It has to be a combination of treatments (depending on your symptoms), but more importantly, it’s all about how you stay active after you walk out of your treatment! 

Anyhow, here’s my thoughts on the different types of treatment: 

Family Doctor: Your Family Doctor is like a central directory/project manager, who oversees how your recovery is going, and recommends you to the most appropriate specialist to follow up with. I find it important to have a long-term Family Doctor who understands the ins and outs to make the most tailored suggestions.
Acupuncture: I find Acupuncture to be the most relaxing type of treatment of all, especially if you have targeted pain points, i.e. around your shoulder and upper back. However, finding an experienced Acupuncturist who’s precise with the points is crucial.
Massage Therapy: If you have severe injuries, I highly recommend seeing a Deep Tissue Massage Therapist, because the purpose is to loosen all the tight clots as a result of a car accident. Avoid going to the type of spa/massages that’s mostly for relaxation purposes, if you’re hoping to get rid of your headaches and pain. Proper Massage Therapy can be painful in order to tighten the muscle clots.
Physiotherapy: Stretching is one of the best ways to stay active, and your physiotherapist would recommend a series of stretches depending on your pain area. Do them daily & consistently with a balance board, resistance bands, etc.! Also, try lying down and loosen your tight spots using a tennis ball!
Chiropractor: Although not feeling the most relaxed after a treatment, I find Chiro to be essential in healing, given that the adjustments (not limited to neck and spine) is the step #1 to prepare your body to be ready for subsequent treatment through re-aligning the joints. However, once your muscle tightness and other symptoms improve, I recommend attending Chiro treatment less frequently to prevent joints from loosening expediately. 


Overall tips:
Usually after a car accident, doctors recommend you to see the combination of: Chiropractor, Physiotherapy & Massage Therapy. I usually book all 3 appointments back to back, in the chronological order as listed above. 
Muay Thai - This is such a fun sport and was extremely beneficial in my recovery (more so than boxing), because it’s core-focused but really involves the whole body movement , especially your hip, which is beneficial for lower back!
