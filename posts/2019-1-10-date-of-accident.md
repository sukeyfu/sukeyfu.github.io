January 10th, 2019, is the most frequent third-party inquiry date in my life. Looking back, it is still hard for me to believe that it’s already been more than 3 years, but the milliseconds in that day, outside my control, changed my entire life ever since.

It started to be a good day - I was still in training at PwC Toronto, meaning that we had the rare opportunity to go home at 5PM on a weekday. I dropped off my bags at home, and left for the gym across a major intersection from where I rented, with only my phone, keys, and a water bottle in the pocket. Naturally an observant, walking towards the intersection, I locked eyes with a fire captain who sat in shotguns, where the fire truck was waiting for a left turn. 

Stopping at the intersection, where I read the big white number of 22 at the light, confidently knowing it’s my right of way, I lifted my right foot, about to step down on the concrete sidewalk …… 

Boom. 

My eyes slowly opened up, lying down, and all I saw was the dark blue sky, it was like waking up to Heaven, so quiet and serene, until I heard noises: “Someone call an ambulance!” “Where the heck did you come from?” “I saw you, you hit her, it was her right of way.”

Trying to make sense of it all, I realised that I am still alive and this is not a dream as I started to feel severe pain in my right foot. Everyone around me was all very nervous, and I felt the need to lighten the mood, so I swung my arms around and told them that I am “okay”.

Being a driver myself, it was not my first time seeing an accident scene and I always generally wondered what happened. Ironically, this time, I’m the centre of the show. Soon enough, the police and ambulance arrived; the paramedics asked for what year we live in today as well as my name, and I had difficulty answering them as I felt super sleepy. Still trying to make sense of it all, I looked around and saw the fire captain and other witnesses talking to the police. I wonder what they saw with their own eyes, specifically, how I flew out and landed on the ground. 

The remainder of the process at the scene went smoothly. Police investigated the scene and asked me if I remembered how I managed to crack the windshield and dented the bumper “lol”. Shortly after, I was put on the stretcher and sent to North York General Hospital (fun fact, I was on the Hospital’s Audit years later, and I told the finance managers that this is all meant to be - giving back to society :P). Waiting in the hospital bed after taking a ton of Tylenol as painkillers, I finally grasped reality and began to feel anxious about the future: what’s the extent of my injury, what about my co-op at PwC, should I tell my parents, etc.? I realised how fortunate we are to be healthy - not having to be in a wheelchair with little strength and unable to do many physical activities independently.

Trying my best to remain calm, while waiting for the emergency doctor, I contacted PwC’s Human Capital team and received prompt response on initiative medical leave. I also texted my best friends that I was hit by a car; hours later they casually walked in, and jaw-dropped when they saw me in person and realised how seriously I was injured. Initially I didn’t want to tell my parents just yet, as I was still waiting for my brain CT’s results - they reside in a different province so I don’t want them to mindlessly worry. However, my best friend made the choice for me and convinced me to call my parents. They took the bad news maturely, which relieved a lot of my stress.

Finally, past 10PM, I was discharged, thankfully with no life-threatening injuries. It’s been a long day and after all, I was just glad that I was still alive. It really is shocking to think back and realise that generally in our daily lives, death seems to be such a distant topic - nobody normally brings it up, but it can happen so easily. Really, in a millisecond, I could’ve never woken up, and, that’s it, I would be gone just like that.   

On that day, I didn’t expect life would get so much more difficult - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Well, that’s another long, long, long story to share.
