In my earlier post, I described some red flags that I personally experienced working under one supervisor on one engagement during my full-time at PwC as a Senior Associate, which was the main trigger that prompted me to search for a new job.

It‚Äôs crazy to think that the person I worked under was a 6/6 on the chart above üòÇ. However, this is not representative of the whole firm, or even a location/service line. A lot of it is luck-based, but we all have a choice!!

As some of you might have also read, prior to the full-time experience, I had the best 16 months of experience in PwC Assurance, so leaving this soon before obtaining my CPA designation was very unexpected and unplanned for. 

Objectively speaking, having experience in Audit develops wonderful transferable skills, so thinking in the long run of your career line, it really depends on your own interests and values, i.e. what impact you‚Äôd like to bring to society, work-life balance, etc. 

But here is a checklist to consider whether it‚Äôs time to try something new: 
1. **Burnt Out:** a combination of feeling exhausted, depressed, angry, stressed; and no one should ever get to this point. With the pandemic fatigue and #wfh (more difficult to set up boundaries), they act as catalysts accelerating burn-out, but in my opinion, burnout can be properly prevented. Temporarily feeling burnt out is not unexpected, but really dig deeper and understand what‚Äôs the cause of your burnt-out (which doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate a toxic working environment). 
2. **Treated Unfairly:** workplace bullying, aka some of the red flags. However, in order to make an informed decision, think in the other person‚Äôs shoes, and figure out their incentives/motives that prompted their behaviour. If that‚Äôs just who they are, you can‚Äôt change them, but you have the power & choice to change your life!
3. **Lack of Meaning:** I don‚Äôt mean that admin work (emails, organising spreadsheets, etc.) is meaningless work, but if you find yourself (unwillingly) doing that for 7 hours a day, and then having to work unpaid overtime hours to do actual problem-solving work, then you will lose interest on the most ‚Äúfun‚Äù part of work, to problem-solve, advise, and create value for clients. 
4. **Not Learning**: when you‚Äôve hit the plateau of the learning curve, and feel that ‚Äúmy time and skills can be better spent elsewhere to make a greater impact‚Äù, it may be more beneficial to hop to a different environment! 
5. **Personal/Practical Reasons**: you know best!  ;)

Overall, my advice is to casually look around for different job postings - to constantly self-reflect and be informed knowing all your options. This absolutely should not conflict with excelling at your current job, which is where you should learn and grow the most from! You can squeeze in 30 minutes a week from scrolling through social media ;) 

Anyhow, to anyone that may be going through something similar, don‚Äôt purposely force yourself to stick it out for the sake of proving to yourself that you are ‚Äútough‚Äù. Speak up to your superiors, and if no practical solutions are proposed, or that they‚Äôre not actually listening (taking the matter seriously and objectively), `start something new`. Don‚Äôt be scared.
