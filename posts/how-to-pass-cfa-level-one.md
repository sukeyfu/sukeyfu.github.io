Surprising to say, after completing CFA Levels 2 & 3, I found CFA Level 1 to be the most challenging - I know, like whaatttt???

I took my CFA Level 1 Exam (paper/scantron) in December 2019, so my notes are not up to date with the latest curriculum (however the high level/big concepts wouldn’t change). Being on a school term, I mostly did 2-3 chapters of reading for a month, and then grinded out the question bank (Free CFA Candidate Resources on the Official website) for 2-3 weeks. Besides, I subscribed to Kaplan Schweser’s free question of the day, and sometimes on the commute to school I would take a quick peak. However, rather than following the “300 hours” guideline, here are my biggest studying tips for passing Level 1 on top 10% percentile studying less than 300 hours:
- **High Level**. CFA Level 1 Exam is mostly based upon understanding the concept behind formulas, and understanding the relationships when manipulating dependent variables and examining the impact/relationships. 
- **Let Go of Nitty-Gritty**. In my opinion, CFA Question Bank (Free Candidate Resources) covers the majority of concepts that you need to know to pass. On the exam, there are always going to be those one-off items that you’ve never heard off, so I do not recommend stressing over those one-off items, rather, it is far more important to understand the big concepts (the ones with more bullet points).
- **Don’t read it all**. If you’re pressed on time, you do not need to stress over not reading through all the learner materials (textbook). Reading the summary at the end of every reading, completing the end of reading questions gives you sufficient high-level coverage of concepts. 
- **Do QUESTIONS**, i.e. CFA Question Bank. This is crucial because CFA Institute phrases their questions and answers in its unique way, and getting used to their wording style saves you time during the exam. 
- **Mindset of a Investor**. Majoring in accounting with an auditor background, so I felt a big change needing to adapt thinking like an investor rather than focusing on the DR CR and the exact name of GL accounts to record. As a CFA Candidate (future investor), going back to my first point, it helps to understand causal relationships and impact on investors.

**Good luck to all writing!! And would love to hear more from those who have taken the computer based exam, in which I’ve heard the questions can be more random.**
