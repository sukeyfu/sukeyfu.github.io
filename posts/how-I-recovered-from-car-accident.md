Following my earlier blog on how I got hit by a car, it was a miracle that I had no fractures. However, given the extent of my injuries where I lost consciousness after “flying out” and somehow landed on the ground, essentially, I had a minor brain damage, but severe foot and muscle injuries.

I was feeling under tremendous stress to get back on my feet ASAP, to return to my co-op job at PwC and finish my challenging undergrad. Looking back, I wouldn’t have put as much stress on myself and prioritised more on recovery. However, throughout my recovery, I’ve met so many individuals who share similar injuries from car accidents or sports, so I had always wanted to share some recovery tips. Disclaimer: this is personally what worked best for me and should not replace proper consultation with a doctor for proper medical diagnosis & advice.

Breaking into 3 categories of injuries & recovery tips: 
1. **Physical** - _headache, whiplash, nightmares, joint body pain, etc._

Eat Well, Sleep Well, and Be Active - honestly this sounds like typical day to day advice to everyone, but they work! Check out each individual brochure for more details!


2. **Psychological** - _anxiety, depression, impatience, PTSD (fear of accident, feeling unstable and stuck)_ 

After the accident, I had to deal with countless paperwork and appointments. The worst part was to repeatedly answer the question “What happened, how are you feeling now?” hundreds of times. It quickly got to a point where I couldn’t hold it anymore, and the whole world just shattered.

Thankfully, I found my Psychotherapist (specialising in reality therapy) that I am compatible with. He helped me to re-allocate and re-glue various pieces of my life back together, through courage and awareness. There are often times where I felt that my Psychotherapist was like an interviewer who kept on drilling deeper in my response to get to the root cause of the issue, but walking out of every session, I felt that the world is suddenly brighter and has a different meaning.  

We talked a lot, from fear of failure to the definition of success and meaning of happiness. My biggest take-away is that life’s meant to be a wavy road, so we must be more aware of where we are going, or else life is too easy (living an easy life is boring). Often, we fear a “wavy” life because we don’t think we have the courage and confidence that we can fix our mistakes. On the other hand, most of our fear is created in our head. The biggest success is to become wise and know what we can learn from failure and pain. 

Lastly, give yourself permission to be happy!!! 

3. **Cognitive** - _whiplash/concussion resulting in memory issues, difficulty to read, concentrate, and process_ 

Concussions happen often among adults, but it can be challenging for university students who are undergoing academic challenges that work the brain hard every day! 

I really recommend seeing a concussion specialist, as they’re able to give a tailored recovery plan that is a combination of exercises and specialised equipment (i.e. Deadweight Pettibon System) that really reboot your brain. The feeling of “Awakening” after fatigue and brain fog clear up is honestly life-changing. Check out a special visit to my concussion doctor in Calgary!

Thankfully I didn’t have any serious brain damage, but from seeing my Neurologist, the 3 recommendations he made were:
	Stress management, better mental health, more physical activity.

Honestly, an oldie but a goodie!


That’s a wrap to a comprehensive guide on how I recovered from the car accident, well, not 100% recovered, but as my psychotherapist said, “Sophie, you’ve recovered. Tell yourself that and go live your life!”
