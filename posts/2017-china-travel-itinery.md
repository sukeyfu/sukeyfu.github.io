We all do something crazy when we’re 18 right? :P 

Given that Summer 2017 was the only term that we had off throughout Undergrad program at UW, it was the only opportunity for me to visit my relatives back in China who live across multiple provinces. So I thought it was the perfect opportunity to take a few months off after ending a long-time relationship, and be immersed in a completely new environment alone.

My first stop was in Xi’An, province of Shanxi, which is the origin of 唐朝 and XX. The mountain of 秦岭 XX. We drove up the mountain to taste some authentic 农家乐, but along the drive up the mountains, for a millisecond, I saw a 身着灰robe的monk, 肩上挑着水, 隐隐约约看见一个土茅屋. The lifestyle is what I long time 心向往之 - To live in the mountains and fully be immersed in nature, away from the city noise and technology, and to see that it is plausible in real life gave me so much motivation knowing that the life I want to live is possible. This lapse of memory has always stayed in my heart over the years, but I often doubt my eyes. It wasn’t until 2022 where I came across the book 空谷幽兰, where I learned that 隐士 origined from the mountain of 秦岭.

Ofc, 西安围城骑车

Next stop, Wuxi, Suzhou - the XX of China. I don’t have relatives in Suzhou, but it is a province that I always wanted to visit, being near water, the 古镇, exquisite food, and delicate 园林. What I visited was a complete different lifestyle, where local residents live in houses that are built on the water, where the river is their backyard.

I stayed at a local Airbnb and my responsibility was to walk the dog everyday

I visited the 步行街, which is a popular tourist place, but also where local residents live in, both during the day and at evening. The streets were more serene in the morning, residents 打扫街道, 晒挂衣服, the peaceful daily life, but in the evening, the streets lit up and were flooded with tourists. What a contrast - the same street showcasing 2 different sides and beauty (风景); standing on the bridge, I realised that polar opposite things can co-exist - like myself. We all have different facets of self, and it is so important to be able to self-reconcile, and self-accept, on the basis of self-realization. This is a life-long journey.

Suzhou really is such a province with exquisite parks and nature sceneries that is well maintained.

Next stop, the city that’s the most important in my heart, my home-town Beijing where I grew up and lived in for 12 years.

When I was young, I had already visited most of the tourist places, so this time, I mostly hung out with my elementary classmates - yes we are still in touch after 12 years! We biked along the streets, karaoke 通宵, and visited my elementary school (unfortunately it was closed so we didn’t get a chance to visit our elementary teacher).

One side note is that I met a lovely couple during my trip to Boston and DC in 2016. This time they heard that I was back in Beijing and kindly hosted me in their 四合院 in Beijing, which is at the corner of the 故宫palace (where 皇宫used to be).

Ofc, in love with the water, I took a stroll near 后海, which was so peaceful and therapeutic, especially in the busiest city of China.

So that’s a recap to the highlights of my 2 months of solo-trip across China. Overall, I had met so many kind people along the way, from taxi drivers, to small shop owners, and strangers on the bus that offered their seat when they saw me holding luggages. My travel philosophy has always been to live like a local, and given that I am familiar with the language, it wasn’t difficult to do so. I would recommend solo-travelling (provided that safety comes first) to everyone - yes it can be inconvenient especially with the commute (so pack light) and without a photographer, but it is such a unique experience to learn more about yourself, given that you are all that you have. Yes, I felt lonely at times especially dining in at restaurants, and walking along streets seeing families around. I often questioned why am I doing this, but my answers are in the sunsets, the trees/water, and the genuine smiles on people’s faces.
